# DragonQuestBattlesAlpha
A simple RPG battle system based on Square-Enix's Dragon Quest games. 

## Description

This was an early creation of mine when I was first learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript and because of that it is VERY rudimentary. The sizing of the overlaying sprites don't really match the window's size, there's no storage (local or otherwise) to save your progress or even carry over data from one fight to the next. 

It is a bad game.

That said, I'm keeping it as a reminder of where I started off. At some point my plan is to recreate this and build off of it, so this is staying on display for posterity.
